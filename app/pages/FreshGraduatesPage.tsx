      The End of an Era: The Decline of Bulk, Degree-Based Hiring
    </h3>
    <p className="leading-loose">
      The era of large corporations absorbing thousands of fresh graduates in
      bulk recruitment drives is drawing to a close. Hiring for entry-level
      roles (0â€“3 years of experience) grew by a modest 3% in 2024. The primary
      catalyst for this shift is AI and automation, which handle tasks once
      performed by entry-level employees, such as routine coding, data entry,
      and compliance reporting. Companies no longer need a large base of
      manpower for repetitive tasks; instead, they are building leaner teams of
      specialists.

      The Skills-First Paradigm: Your Degree is a Foundation, Not a Finisher
    </h3>
    <p className="leading-loose">
      Employers have unequivocally shifted to a "skills-first" hiring model. A
      degree is now viewed as a foundational credential, but it is the
      possession of tangible, in-demand skills that secures a job. This shift
      confronts the widening gap between academic curricula and industry
      demands. The burden of initial, practical training has shifted from the
      employer to the individual student. Companies explicitly prefer graduates
      who are "future-ready" with industry-relevant skills, certifications, and
      project experience before being hired.

      The Fresher's Action Plan: Building Your "Portfolio of Proof"
    </h3>
    <p className="leading-loose">
      Your resume must be a "portfolio of proof" that substantiates your claims
      of being skilled and job-ready.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Prioritize Internships:</strong> They have become the primary
        filtering mechanism. Proactively seek internships to gain critical,
        real-world experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Develop a Tangible Project Portfolio:</strong> Demonstrate your
        ability to apply knowledge through personal projects, open-source
        contributions (e.g., on GitHub), and participating in hackathons.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Acquire Strategic Certifications:</strong> Research your target
        industry and acquire recognized certifications, such as a Google Data
        Analytics Professional Certificate or an AWS Certified Cloud
        Practitioner certification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cultivate and Showcase Soft Skills:</strong> Communication,
        critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork are more valuable than
        ever. Actively develop and articulate these skills.
